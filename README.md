# Hexayurt Cutter
The [Hexayurt](https://www.appropedia.org/Hexayurt_playa) is a shelter made from standard-sized sheets of 8' by 4' building material, with no waste. Versions made out of [foil-laminated polyisocyanurate insulation board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyisocyanurate) are popular shelters at [Burning Man](https://burningman.org).

Mitring the edges of the panels allows the yurt to fit together better, improving insulation, dust- and light-proofing. Doing so with hand tools is very tricky, until now.

3D printing this cutter and fitting a [standard 18mm snap-off blade](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=18mm+snap+off+blade&crid=1X0J38O0XKV1W&sprefix=18mm+snap%2Caps%2C228&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_3_9) into the appropriate slot allows you to simply push the cutter over the edge of the board and cut the perfect angle.
